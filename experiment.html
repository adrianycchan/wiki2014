                        <h2>Project Description</h2>
                        <p>
                        Our system integrates a proven boron source, boronophenylalanine (BPA) along with a reliable cancer-targeting agent (folic acid) into a multifunctional, layered gold nanoparticle (LGNP). This is done by starting with a 5 nm gold core, after which alternating layers of cationic polyelectrolyte (4-Borono-L-Phenylalanine-Poly(fluorescein isothiocyanate allylamine) hydrochloride (BPA:FITC-PAH)) and anionic polyelectrolyte (4-Borono-L-Phenylalanine-Poly(4-styrene sulfonate) (BPA:PSS)) are electrostatically deposited onto the nanoparticle surface. Lastly, folic acid is electrostatically functionalized to the surface of the layered particle.
This layered gold nanoparticle forms the basis of the Boron Neutron Capture Therapy segment of the project.
						</p>
                        <p>
To create a more versatile and all-around complete system, the LGNP was combined with tensegrity DNA origami structures. These tensegrity DNA origami structures are synthesized, and then "walked" over a 150 nm by 100 nm flat DNA origami tile. These "walkers" have three binding sites to which cargoes may be attached during walking. The LGNP is bound to one of these sites via EDC-sulfo-NHS coupling (see protocols). This leaves two unoccupied sites for other cargoes to add further capabilities to our system, such as tracking and imaging, additional drug delivery or enhanced targeting. 
						</p>
                        <p>
We initially explored several options for these extra cargoes, including quantum dots and iron oxide nanoparticles for enhanced imaging. Though the gold nanoparticle is a capable MRI enhancer, additional imaging and tracking would be valuable to the system. We then realized that it would be necessary to consider the size of our LGNP relative to the walker and tile, as well as the possible consequences of adding another larger cargo. Due to limited time and resources, we were unable to test these in the lab over the summer. 
						</p>
                        <p>
Despite this, we were able to utilize one of the two available binding sites with biotinylated DNA. This was used as a proof-of-concept for a true cancer-targeting agent; in a clinical setting, a cancer-targeting agent would be substituted. The key accomplishment here is that we were able to demonstrate the possibility of adding a second useful cargo to our LGNP-walker system. 
						</p>
                        <p>
In summary, we demonstrate a fully integrated, self-assembling DNA origami-gold nanoparticle cancer-targeting system based on Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) principles. The system brings together a BPA and folic acid functionalized layered gold nanoparticle for BNCT with tensegrity DNA origami walkers for the possible addition of further capabilities and applications with more cargoes. Though more work would be required to investigate these additional applications further, it was possible to conjugate biotinylated DNA to our walkers, thereby indicating the possibility of adding a cancer-targeting agent. Nevertheless, the system as it is actively targets and destroys cancer cells while leaving healthy cells unharmed.

                        <h2>Motivation for Project</h2>
                        <p>
                        	Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) is a promising alternative treatment for head and neck cancers. Initially proposed as a possible cancer treatment in 1936 by Gordon L. Locher, BNCT has been previously investigated by various research groups [4]. BNCT is an attractive and strongly pursued cancer treatment due to its ability to selectively target and destroy tumour cells, which is beyond the capability of traditional cancer treatments including chemotherapy.

                        Figure 1: In BNCT, a beam of low energy neutrons combines with boron in the tumour cells. The neutron beam is sent straight through the patient's skull [4].

                        </figure>  </center>
                        <p>
BNCT is based on a simple reaction involving neutrons and boron-10. When low- energy neutrons come into contact with boron-10, the unstable boron-11 isotope forms. The isotope then undergoes nuclear fission, resulting in high-energy lithium-7 nuclei (or lithium 3+ ions) and alpha particles carrying 2.31 MeV of energy as shown below.

                        Figure 2: The Fundamental BNCT reaction. When hit with neutrons, boron-10 collapses into boron 11, giving off lithium -7 (Li 3+) and high-energy alpha particles [4].

                        <p>
This alpha-particle radiation will destroy any biological material within a 5-9 &mu;m radius of the boron source, roughly the diameter of a cell. In principle, if a sufficient amount of boron could be accumulated in tumour cells with negligible uptake into healthy cells, this would prove to be a viable targeted cancer therapeutic system.

                        Figure 3: BNCT in action--the cancerous cell (blue) contains boron. Upon completion of the BNCT reaction, it will be destroyed and the healthy cells (orange) will remain unharmed [4].

                        <p>
There are two challenges imposed with this method: First the need to target the tumour cells for selective delivery of the boron source, and second, to ensure that a sufficient quantity of boron is up-taken for guaranteed cell death. 
						</p>
                        <p>
Multiple approaches to these problems have been explored in recent years. This includes the boron source used in this project, boronophenylalanine (BPA), which has been used in clinical trials in both Finland and Sweden from 1999-2002 [5,6]. To address the targeting issue, folic acid is used as a targeting agent as it will preferentially attach to the over-expressed folic acid receptors on the tumour cells.

                        <h3>Results</h3>
                        <p>
                        The relative reagent proportions for stock synthesis were referenced from Chanana et. al [1] and Mandal et. al [2].  When first attempting to make a B-PSS<sub>DDIW</sub> stock without pH = 8 solution, it was observed that a white particulate was still present in solution even after vigorous and prolonged vortexing (upwards of 10 minutes).  After synthesizing PSS<sub>DDIW</sub> without the particulate observed, we deduced that the BPA was insoluble at the concentrations present, and so we raised the pH of the solution in order to solvate it.  Indeed, it was confirmed that BPA has a low solubility of approximately 1.6 g/mL.  All other solutions were successfully synthesized from referenced instruction.

                              <h3>Results</h3>
                              <p>Initial centrifugation did not produce stable pellets, and so centrifugation time was increased with respect to the referenced procedure by Chanana et al. [1].  Times for incubation were also modified, as we predicted that changing incubation times would not have significant impact on results.</p>

<p>The GNP solution and subsequently layered samples are always added drop-wise to the next layer of polyelectrolytes in order to avoid colloidal destabilization.  Incubation in dark environments is also done for the same purpose.</p>

<p>Our first attempts at GNP polyelectrolyte layering was intended to be split into 9 hour work days with 1 layer per day.  However, initial results of our first attempts at GNP layering returned expected hydrodynamic radii and low PDI on the first DLS run, but extremely large hydrodynamic radii on the second DLS run along with a high PDI.  This indicated that aggregation had most likely occurred during the incubation of the singly layered B-FITC-PAH<sub>DDIW</sub> GNP.  After deliberation with team members, it was concluded that the most likely cause of aggregation was a competitive removal of the stabilizing citrate dianion shell by the polycationic electrolyte.  Normally, GNPs are prone to aggregation at even slight temperature, light, or physical disturbance due to their low, slightly negative surface potential.  Therefore, citrate buffer is used to stabilize the GNPs in a dianion shell, which effectively increases the surface charge, creating a stabilizing electrostatic repulsion between particles.  However, after removal of this citrate layer by the polycationic electrolyte, the electrostatic repulsion was insufficient for keeping the particles stabilized, and aggregation occurred while the particles were incubated overnight.  The first Zeta-Potential measurement of the first polycationic layer agrees with this hypothesis, indicating a positive, but low surface charge (approximately +5 mV) on the singly layered particles.  The second Zeta-Potential measurement, however, returned sufficiently high values (approximately -50 mV).  It was decided then that two layers would have to be done per day in order to end the day on a polyanionic electrolyte layer so that the particles would not aggregate during incubation overnight.</p>
						
<p>Final results show that our nanoparticles are approximately 100 nm in diameter with a slightly negative surface charge.  This result was expected, as Mandal et al. [2] also observed a particle collapse and predicted a reduced stability due to sodium chloride being used as a solvent for the outer layer (the ideal theoretical diameter is 125 nm - 5 nm for the core, and 20 nm of diameter per layer added).  Our results convey maximum colloidal stability to be reached at the fourth polyelectrolyte layer.  However, we decided to use 6 layers, as the outer layer solvent of sodium chloride is important for biocompatibility.  Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) characterization confirmed that our layered nanoparticles were approximately 100 nm in diameter, and that aggregation had occurred to a moderate level due to the low surface potential.  Black dots of high electron density were observed in the TEM images, which represent the BPA conjugated into the polyelectrolyte layers.</p>

                        <h3>Results</h3>
                        <p>
                        The conjugation of folic acid to the LGNPs was done by protonating the folic acid primary amine group (pKa = 2.35) to make a positively charged, resonance stabilized analogue of folic acid. This electrostatically binds with the anionic sulfate groups of the PSS layer of the LGNP. This leaves the nanoparticles with carboxyl groups on the surface to react for the coupling reaction. The successful reaction was visible, since the folic acid solution was yellow. Upon the reaction of the LGNPs with the folic acid, the resulting pellet after centrifugation was yellow, while the rest of the solution was clear. This indicated that the folic acid was tethered to the LGNPs.</p>

<p>The biotinylated DNA is conjugated onto the DNA via direct reaction. In our case, the cassette and tile system is not required because we are only adding one functional attachment to the walker. In the case that more attachments are required, the walkers can be walked across the tile using a preset thermocycler program.</p>
 
<p>This coupling method was modified from a procedure by Gabarek and Gergely [3] (used from Fischer Scientific Product Instructions). It links a carboxy-terminated molecule with an amine-terminated molecule with a zero-length crosslink. The procedure was used to link the carboxylic group on folic acid to the amine group(s) on the walkers. This procedure was not verified through characterization methods due to constraints in time and resources. However, the AFM results of the procedure will be presented at Biomod 2014. </p>

                        <p>This is the procedure to create the DNA walkers. It is the functional nanoparticle and payload carrier in the system. Depending on the requirements, it can be programmed later to host different attachments such as gold, quantum dots, and so on.</p>

<p>They are prepared from a pre-prepared batch of DNA that has been ordered as programmed strands to assemble the walkers after specific thermocycling. Therefore, the following procedure has to be followed very carefully for the self-assembling phenomenon to occur.</p>

                        <h3>Results</h3>
                        <p>The walkers in this experiment turned out well for the experiment, as they were able to fulfill the purpose of hosting the biotinylated DNA, and were also able to bind to the LGNPs. However, our AFM images show that there was significant aggregation visible in the sample, likely as a result of discrepancies in volumes added, as well as some discrepancies with leaving samples outside the freezer for a long duration. The expected size of the walkers was around 10 nm, but the observed size of the particles according to the AFM images is around 80 - 100 nm.</p>

The DNA tile is 150 nm by 200 nm, so 3 cassettes can effectively be fit onto the tile. The cassettes will be conjugated with their respective cargoes before proceeding with walking the walker across the tile.</p>
